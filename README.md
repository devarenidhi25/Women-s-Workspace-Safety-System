# **Womenâ€™s Workplace Safety & Support System (SAKHI)**

**SAKHI** is a web-based platform designed to provide a safe and supportive space for women across various workplaces to report incidents such as harassment, verbal abuse, or unsafe working conditions. The system allows female employees to securely report workplace incidents, receive AI-driven mental health and legal guidance through a chatbot, and ensures confidentiality and compliance with **The POSH Act, 2013**. The system generates reports and sends them to the Internal Complaints Committee (IIC) for redressal.
